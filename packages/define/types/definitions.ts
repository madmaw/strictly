// NOTE: this file, in conjunction with the types that derive information from these types, pushes the
// Typescript compiler to its absolute limit. It tends to be a death of 1000 cuts so no individual feature
// breaks it. When combined they hit some threshold (memory? performance? time?) beyond which the compiler
// gives up. To avoid problems try to follow these guidelines
// 1. Keep types as simple as possible.
// If you find yourself having to unwrap a bunch of boolean flags (for example) you're probably going to encounter issues
// 2. Only expose externally, and pass internally, the absolute minimum information information you need
// TS tends to get overwhelmed, where you can, narrow the types that are being returned to just the information
// the caller needs
// 3. Take advantage of helper functions to hide complexity/fragility from client code
// 4. Manually unroll complex operations
// Typescript can choke on things like the below, however you can manually do a full implementation where you
// check each type and return the appropriate value, and that seems to work.
// ```
// type HomogeneousFattenedValue<T extends TypeDef, V> = { [K in keyof FlattenedOf<T>]?: V }
// ```
// 5. Use longhand { [s: string]: number } instead of Record<string, number> when doing transformations and
// defining types
